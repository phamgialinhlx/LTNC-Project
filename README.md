- A clone of Chrome Dino (chrome://dino/)
- Complete this game with the lore, effects and animation.

## Systems and Engine
Preparation:
- C++ Basic
- Map, Iterator and Pointer in C++
- Object Oriented Programming in C++
- Split code into multiple files in C++
- SDL2 Libraries
- Resources of the game (images, sprites, sound)

Engine:
- class Wolf

Cách tổ chức game:
- Các class `Wolf`, `character`, `Score`, `Particle`, `backGround` inherit from class `gameObjects`
- Game Loop:
  - Handle input
  - Update all `gameObjects` by input
  - Render all `gameObjects`   

## Rules
- Your mission: Don't let your character die by pressing the *SPACE* bar to evade the obstacles.
